@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Vcomplete provides a minor mode enhancing the default completion list
buffer, providing visual aids for selecting completions and performing
other actions. It's designed to build upon the default completion
system, instead of replacing it. As such, it works both when
completing in a minibuffer and in normal buffers.

@node Installation
@chapter Installation

swsw can be installed from GNU ELPA: (not available yet)

@table @asis
@item @kbd{M-x package-install RET vcomplete RET}
@end table

@end menu

@node Installing a release
@section Installing a release

Simply download a release (from
<https://dsemy.com/software/vcomplete>), and install it:

@table @asis
@item @kbd{M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/download/vcomplete-VERSION.tar RET}
@end table

@node Installing from the Git repository
@section Installing from the Git repository

Clone the repository and build the package archive:

@example
$ git clone https://git.sr.ht/~dsemy/vcomplete $ cd vcomplete $ make
@end example

Install the package:

@table @asis
@item @kbd{M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/clone/vcomplete-VERSION.tar RET}
@end table

@node Usage
@chapter Usage

In order to use any feature of the package, @code{vcomplete-mode} must
be enabled:

@cindex vcomplete-mode
@table @asis
@item @kbd{M-x vcomplete-mode RET}
You can also add @code{(vcomplete-mode)} to your init file, instead.
@end table

The following commands assume completion is in progress.

@kindex C-n
@cindex vcomplete-next-completion
@table @asis
@item @kbd{C-n}
Select the next displayed completion
(@code{vcomplete-next-completion}).  This command moves point in the
completion list buffer to the next available completion, and
highlights it. This command may be used to advance multiple
completions at a time with a prefix argument.
@end table

@kindex C-p
@cindex vcomplete-prev-completion
@table @asis
@item @kbd{C-p}
Select the previous displayed completion
(@code{vcomplete-prev-completion}).  This command moves point in the
completion list buffer to the previous available completion, and
highlights it. This command may be used to advance multiple
completions at a time with a prefix argument.
@end table

@kindex M-RET
@cindex vcomplete-choose-completion
@table @asis
@item @kbd{M-RET}
Choose the current completion (@code{vcomplete-choose-completion}).
This command chooses the highlighted completion, ending completion.
@end table

@kindex C-x k
@cindex vcomplete-kill-buffer
@table @asis
@item @kbd{C-x k}
Kill the buffer corresponding to the current completion
(@code{vcomplete-kill-buffer}). This command kills the buffer
corresponding to the currently highlighted (or last highlighted)
completion, if such buffer exists.
@end table

@xref{Completion commands} for information regarding defining new
commands.

@node Customization
@chapter Customization

All customization, except for defining custom completion commands can
be done through the customize interface:

@table @asis
@item @kbd{M-x customize-group RET vcomplete RET}
@end table

@defopt vcomplete-auto-help
Whether the @code{*Completions*} buffer should open automatically.
Non-nil means automatically open. Otherwise, operate according to
@code{completion-auto-help}. By default, @code{t} is used.
@end defopt

@menu
* Completion commands::
@end menu

@node Completion commands
@section Completion commands

Completion commands are used to perform operations on specific
completion candidates. They are normal commands (interactive
functions) which are bound to a key sequence in
@code{vcomplete-command-map}.  @code{vcomplete-next-completion},
@code{vcomplete-prev-completion}, @code{vcomplete-choose-completion}
and @code{vcomplete-kill-buffer} are implemented as completion
commands.

@defvar vcomplete-command-map
Key map which holds key bindings to completion commands. This key map
should be available whenever completion is initiated.
@end defvar

@defmac vcomplete-with-completions-buffer body...
Evaluate BODY with the @code{*Completions*} buffer temporarily
current.  While evaluating body, BUFFER and WINDOW are locally bound
to the @code{*Completions*} buffer and window respectively. This macro
can be used to easily manipulate or access the contents of the
@code{*Completions*} buffer.
