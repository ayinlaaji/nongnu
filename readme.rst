Emacs InkPot Theme
==================

This theme is a port of the Vim InkPot theme for Emacs ``deftheme``.

This theme is quite close to
`Vim's wonderful InkPot theme <http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1143>`__.


Notes
-----

Added extra faces for:

- ``gnus``.
- ``org-mode``.
- ``ivy-mode``.
- ``helm-mode``.
- ``highlight-indent-guides``.
- ``highlight-number`` *(needed to match the original themes number color)*.


Additions, corrections, and improvements are most welcome.
