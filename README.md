## Introduction

The rfc-mode Emacs major mode is a browser and reader for RFC documents.

## Installation

The package should be installed from MELPA. After that, just load rfc-mode:

```elisp
(require 'rfc-mode)
```

Call `rfc-mode-browse` to choose a RFC document to read, or `rfc-mode-read` to
enter the reference of the RFC document yourself.
