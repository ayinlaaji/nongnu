Installation
============

MELPA
-----

Subatomic is available in [MELPA](http://melpa.milkbox.net/). Assuming MELPA is added to your archive list you can list the available packages by typing <code>M-x list-packages</code>, look for subatomic-theme, mark it for installation by typing <code>i</code> and then execute (install) by typing <code>x</code>.

(Or you can install it directly with <code>M-x package-install RET subatomic-theme</code>)

After that, enable the theme by <code>M-x load-theme RET subatomic</code>.

Or if you want to do it in your init file, add:

```lisp
(load-theme 'subatomic t)
```
