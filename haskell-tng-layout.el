;;  This algorithm must expose a stateless API so that stateless lexing is
;;  possible (see SMIE). However, as the layout is queried for every token
;;  during lexing, this must also be very efficient. Therefore, caching is used
;;  internally.

;; Notes on caching
;;
;; Small brain parses the entire buffer, invalidated by any change.
;;
;; Big brain parses toplevel regions of interest, invalidated by any changes.
;; This is what we do.
;;
;; Galaxy brain caching would use properties and put dirty markers on inserted
;; or deleted regions. Would give fast lookup at point.

;; Regions are exclusive of START and inclusive of END, and do not overlap. This
;; is because START would only ever contain CLOSE or SEP, not OPEN.
;;
;; Instead of a list, may also be t, indicating that there is no relevant layout
