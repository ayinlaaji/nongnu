	- mitigated bug that prevented rendering of annotation in
          org-mode forcing 'newline' policy for annotation
          positioning.
          See the local function
          'maybe-force-newline-policy' in 'annotate-create-annotation'.
        - choosen the window that contains the current buffer when resizing the annotations
          see variable 'current-window' in 'annotate-lineate';
        - redraw buffer if one of its annotations is deleted
          operating from the summary window.
          see: 'annotate-summary-delete-annotation-button-pressed'.

        * annotate.el (annotate--font-lock-matcher):
        - fixed error for regexp search
	Sometimes some modes/package puts overlay on the last character of a
	buffer (notably SLIME when the parenthesis of a form are not
        balanced). This will make 're-search-forward' in the aforementioned
        function fails and font lock becomes a mess (e.g. text color
        disappears).

	* annotate.el (annotate--font-lock-matcher annotate-bounds annotate-symbol-strictly-at-point annotate-next-annotation-change annotate-previous-annotation-change annotate-clear-annotations annotate-annotate)
	- prevented fails of fontification of annotated regions
	As we walk across the overlays we can get past the limit;
	- mark buffer as modified even if the only action the user performed
	was clearing annotation (and at least an annotation was present in
	the file)
	- prevented annotation of text marked with a region that overlap with
	an existing annotation.

	* annotate.el (annotate-annotation-force-newline-policy annotate-annotation-newline-policy-forced-p annotate-summary-delete-annotation-button-pressed annotate--annotation-builder)

	- used  an heuristic  to force newline  policy when  the annotated
	text  does  not  uses a  standard  fonts  (using  font  height  as
	comparison);

	-  when, in  summary  window,  the delete  button  is pressed  the
	software take care of reload  annotate mode for the visited buffer
	the annotation button is referring to;

	- when re-flowing annotation the window width was calculated always
	for the current buffer (the one with the focus).
