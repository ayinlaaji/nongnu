        * annotate.el (defun annotate-annotation-force-newline-policy,

	- mitigated bug that prevented rendering of annotation in
          org-mode forcing 'newline' policy for annotation
          positioning.
          See the local function
          'maybe-force-newline-policy' in 'annotate-create-annotation'.
        - choosen the window that contains the current buffer when resizing the annotations
          see variable 'current-window' in 'annotate-lineate';
        - redraw buffer if one of its annotations is deleted
          operating from the summary window.
          see: 'annotate-summary-delete-annotation-button-pressed'.

        * annotate.el (annotate--font-lock-matcher):
        - fixed error for regexp search
	  Sometimes some modes/package puts overlay on the last character of a
	  buffer (notably SLIME when the parenthesis of a form are not
          balanced). This will make 're-search-forward' in the aforementioned
          function fails and font lock becomes a mess (e.g. text color
          disappears).
