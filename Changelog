        * annotate.el (annotate-annotation-force-newline-policy,
                       annotate-annotation-newline-policy-forced-p,

                       annotate-summary-delete-annotation-button-pressed):
        - mitigated bug that prevented rendering of annotation in
          org-mode forcing 'newline' policy for annotation
          positioning.
          See the local function
          'maybe-force-newline-policy' in 'annotate-create-annotation'.
        - chosen the window that contains the current buffer when resizing the annotations
          see variable 'current-window' in 'annotate-lineate';
        - redraw buffer if one of its annotations is deleted
          operating from the summary window.
          see: 'annotate-summary-delete-annotation-button-pressed'.

        * annotate.el (annotate--font-lock-matcher):
        - fixed error for regexp search
        Sometimes some modes/package puts overlay on the last character of a
        buffer (notably SLIME when the parenthesis of a form are not
        balanced). This will make 're-search-forward' in the aforementioned
        function fails and font lock becomes a mess (e.g. text color
        disappears).

        * annotate.el (annotate--font-lock-matcher annotate-bounds annotate-symbol-strictly-at-point annotate-next-annotation-change annotate-previous-annotation-change annotate-clear-annotations annotate-annotate)
        - prevented fails of fontification of annotated regions
        As we walk across the overlays we can get past the limit;
        - mark buffer as modified even if the only action the user performed
        was clearing annotation (and at least an annotation was present in
        the file)
        - prevented annotation of text marked with a region that overlap with
        an existing annotation.

        * annotate.el (annotate-annotation-force-newline-policy annotate-annotation-newline-policy-forced-p annotate-summary-delete-annotation-button-pressed annotate--annotation-builder)

        - used  an heuristic  to force newline  policy when  the annotated
        text  does  not  uses a  standard  fonts  (using  font  height  as
        comparison);

        -  when, in  summary  window,  the delete  button  is pressed  the
        software take care of reload  annotate mode for the visited buffer
        the annotation button is referring to;

        - when re-flowing annotation the window width was calculated always
        for the current buffer (the one with the focus).

        * annotate.el

        - each annotation (the overlay, actually) now has a property 'position
          and its  value indicates which  positions the annotations holds  in a
          "chain"  of  annotations.

          Even  if  rendered separately  each  chain  represents a  single
          annotation.

          The last annotation in the chain has position's value equal to -1.

          If  the set  of a  group/chain  is formed  by only  one element  the
          position's value is -1 as well.

          Please note that this changes impacted more or less the whole
          package's code.

        * annotate.el (annotate-annotate)

	- fixed annotation picking in 'annotate-annotate'
          at  the  beginning  of  the  function we  was  picking  the  first
	  available  overlay.   So  the annotated  text  contained  multiple
	  overlays and an  annotation was not the first we  missed the last,
	  This means, for example, that the annotation was not modifiable.
2020-03-16 Bastian Bechtold, cage
        * annotate.el (annotate-create-annotation)

	- fixed managing return value of
	"(get-text-property changed-face-pos 'face)"

	When finding  the face of a portion  of buffer, to try to  get the right
	positioning   of   the    annotation,   using:

	"(get-text-property changed-face-pos 'face)"

	the code  assumed this function returned  a symbol (the face  of the
	text) or nil: this is  incorrect according to the documentation; the
	code above can returns a symbol, a plist or even list of symbols.
