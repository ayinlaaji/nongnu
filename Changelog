        * annotate.el (annotate--font-lock-matcher):
        - fixed error for regexp search
	Sometimes some modes/package puts overlay on the last character of a
	buffer (notably SLIME when the parenthesis of a form are not
        balanced). This will make 're-search-forward' in the aforementioned
        function fails and font lock becomes a mess (e.g. text color
        disappears).

	* annotate.el (annotate--font-lock-matcher annotate-bounds nnotate-symbol-strictly-at-point annotate-next-annotation-change annotate-previous-annotation-change annotate-clear-annotations annotate-annotate)
	- prevented fails of fontification of annotated regions
	As we walk across the overlays we can get past the limit;
	- mark buffer as modified even if the only action the user performed
	was clearing annotation (and at least an annotation was present in
	the file)
	- prevented annotation of text marked with a region that overlap with
	an existing annotation.
