        * annotate.el (annotate--font-lock-matcher):
        - fixed error for regexp search
	  Sometimes some modes/package puts overlay on the last character of a
	  buffer (notably SLIME when the parenthesis of a form are not
          balanced). This will make 're-search-forward' in the aforementioned
          function fails and font lock becomes a mess (e.g. text color
          disappears).
