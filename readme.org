* Racket and Geiser talk to each other

This package provides support for using [[http://racket-lang.org][Racket]] in Emacs with [[http://geiser.nongnu.org][Geiser]].

The easiest way to install ~geiser-racket~ is from MELPA, using ~M-x
package-install RET geiser-racket~.

Files with the `.rkt` and `.ssl` extensions should be automatically
recognized as racket-flavoured geiser buffers.
