swsw - simple window switching

DESCRIPTION

swsw is an Emacs package which provides a minor mode for switching windows
similarly to `ace-window' and `switch-window'.

USAGE

When swsw-mode is active:
- A single character CHAR is added to the beginning of the mode line of each
  active window.
- A single (predefined) character CHAR corresponds to the minibuffer.
- Pressing M-x swsw-select RET CHAR switches focus to the window which
  corresponds to CHAR.

INSTALLATION

Currently, only manual installation is available:

1. Clone the repository:

$ cd $your_emacs_directory

$ git clone 'https://git.sr.ht/~dsemy/swsw'

2. Load the package and enable the minor mode:

;; vanilla
(add-to-list 'load-path (locate-user-emacs-file "swsw"))
(require 'swsw)
(swsw-mode)

;; use-package
(use-package swsw
  :load-path "swsw/"
  :config
  (swsw-mode))

KNOWN ISSUES

- swsw only ever assigns a single character to a window, which means that if
  there are more active windows than specified characters, swsw won't be able
  to switch to some of them.
- swsw can switch to, but can't display the ID of windows which don't have a
  mode line.
