swsw - simple window switching

DESCRIPTION

swsw is an Emacs package which provides a minor mode for switching windows
similarly to `ace-window' and `switch-window'.

USAGE

When swsw-mode is active:
- A window ID is displayed using a mode line lighter or a display function.
- A single (predefined) character CHAR corresponds to the minibuffer.
- Pressing M-x swsw-select RET ID switches focus to the window which
  corresponds to ID, or to the minibuffer if CHAR is entered.

INSTALLATION

Currently, only manual installation is available:

1. Clone the repository:

$ cd $your_emacs_directory

$ git clone 'https://git.sr.ht/~dsemy/swsw'

2. Load the package and enable the minor mode:

;; vanilla
(add-to-list 'load-path (locate-user-emacs-file "swsw"))
(require 'swsw)
(swsw-mode)

;; use-package
(use-package swsw
  :load-path "swsw/"
  :config
  (swsw-mode))
