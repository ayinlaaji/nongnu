swsw - Simple window switching

swsw (simple window switching) is an Emacs package which provides a minor mode
for switching to windows using IDs assigned to them automatically.

Installation:

Currently, only manual installation is available:

Clone the repository:

$ cd

$ git clone 'https://git.sr.ht/~dsemy/swsw'

Install the package:

M-x package-install-file RET ~/swsw.el RET

Usage:

Enable `swsw-mode' and (optionally) bind `swsw-select' to a key:

(swsw-mode)
(define-key swsw-mode-map "C-x o" #'swsw-select)

For use-package users:

(use-package swsw
  :demand ; :bind keyword causes loading to defer.
  :bind
  (:map swsw-mode-map
        ("C-x o" . swsw-select))
  :config
  (swsw-mode))

When swsw-mode is active:
- A window ID is displayed using a mode line lighter or a display function (see
  `swsw-display-function').
- A single (predefined) character corresponds to the minibuffer (see
  `swsw-minibuffer-id').
- Window IDs are assigned to all windows on all frames (by default, see
  `swsw-scope').

C-x o RET ID (if bound) or M-x swsw-select RET ID switches focus to the window
which corresponds to ID.

You can customize `swsw-mode' using the customize interface:

M-x customize-group RET swsw RET
