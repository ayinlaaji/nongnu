  - prevented crash when a window (containing annotations) is resized;
  - prevented loss of undo tree when annotations is modified;
  - positioning of annotation is customizable;
  - added a summary window to display annotations; the summary results
    can be filtered by a simple query language. Deleting or

  - info files can be annotated (thanks to randomwangran);
  - annotated text on the same lines are highlighted with two
    different, alternating, colors;
  - annotate try to check file modifications using checksum and warns
    user if the file has been modified when annotate minor mode was

  - fixed bugs that makes some annotations overlaps;
  - fixed some bugs in fontifications of multiline annotation;
  - when the only user interactions, before saving, with a visited file was
    the call of 'annotate-clear-annotations' the annotations
    will shows again at reload, this should be fixed now.

- 2020-03-06 V0.5.3 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::
  - Partially fixed bug that prevented annotation of buffer when org-mode was used;

- 2020-11-20 V0.9.2 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  This version fix a regression and  some more bug that could breaks a
  multiline  annotation  in  ways  that makes  the  annotation  system
  inconsistent  and  renders the  annotated  text  in wrong  way  (for
  details see the Changelog).

  The 'annotate-file' can be now  safely declared buffer-local so that
  multiple databases of annotations can be used on a per-buffer basis.

  For practical applications see:

  https://github.com/bastibe/annotate.el/issues/68

  Many thanks to gopar for spotting  this elusive bug and help testing
  the patch! :)

- 2020-12-16 V1.0.0 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  This version  allow overwrite of notes.  That is, user can  place an
  annotation on  top of an already  existing one. The new  will delete
  overlapped portion of the old annotation.

  Also a new  customizable variable ('annotate-warn-if-hash-mismatch')
  has  been  added.   When  nil   prevent  printing  of  warning  when
  annotation database's' hash and file has do not match;

  Also a problem with adjacent annotation's coloring has been fixed.

- 2020-12-24 V1.1.0 Bastian Bechtold, cage ::

  This version  improves the  visual style of  annotated text  that if
  formed by more than one line.

  Also  the file  path  of each  annotated file  (in  the database  of
  annotation)     is    saved     so    called     abbreviated    form
  (e.g. '/home/user/foo' is saved as  '~/foo', this could be useful if
  the database is migrated from one machine to another.

  This  improvements has  been suggested  by  the user  Ran that  also
  helped testing this new version of the package. Thank you!

  Finally import and export of annotation has been fixed.

  Related to the last  fix the variable ~annotate-diff-export-context~
  has been removed.

  This  version improves  visual  of multilined  notes  placed on  the
  window margins.
