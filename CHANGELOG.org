#+TITLE: Evil Numbers CHANGELOG

* 0.5

** Additions
+ Make padding optional.
+ Add support for block selections.
+ Add support for subscript and superscript numbers.
+ Add g C-a like functionality
  (i.e. increment first number in selection by 1, second one by 2 and so on).
+ Pad negative numbers and add a plus sign if a negative number is turned into
  a positive number (if padding is enabled).

** Fixes
+ Fix numbers being pushed out of selections
  (e.g. calling inc-at-pt on ^9 9$ where ^$ denote the start and end of the selection would result in 10 9).
