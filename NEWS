swsw NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

* 1.1

** Add the ability to customize the scope of swsw-mode.
swsw-scope controls in which frames swsw-mode tracks windows.

** Fix conditional display functions potentially breaking when the user presses
C-g ('keyboard-quit') while reading a window ID.

* 1.0

** Stable version.
All user facing customization options will accept and correctly handle values
accepted by this version until (at least) version 2.0.
All user facing customization options introduced between this version and
version 2.0 will be accept and handle correctly values accepted by that version
until (at least) version 2.0.
Note: no version 2.0 is planned currently.

** Add support for multi-character IDs.
IDs can now be constructed from multiple character, taken from swsw-id-chars,
when there are enough tracked windows.

** Add support for alternate display functions.
A new customization variable has been added: swsw-display-function.
If it is set to a function, that function is used to display window IDs instead
of the mode-line lighter.
See the documentation of the variable for more information.
Two reference functions are provided:
swsw-mode-line-display-function displays window IDs similarly to the way they
were displayed before version 0.3.
swsw-mode-line-conditional-display-function displays window IDs in the same way
but only when window selection is in progress.

* 0.3

** Add a sparse key map to swsw-mode.
This allows creating key bindings which are only active when swsw-mode is.

** Use a mode-line lighter to show the window ID instead of adding it to the
start of the mode-line.
The lighter is only displayed if the window is tracked by swsw.

* 0.2

** Switching to the minibuffer is now possible.
It is now possible to switch to the minibuffer (if it's active) by
pressing a character unique to the minibuffer window (default 'm').

** Use read-char instead of read-char-from-minibuffer.
swsw-select used read-char-from-minibuffer with swsw-id-prompt as the
prompt previously.
The new implementation doesn't show a prompt (so swsw-id-prompt was
removed completely), and works on older Emacs versions.

* 0.1

** Initial version.
