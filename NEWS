Vcomplete NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.
See the end of the file for an explanation of the versioning scheme.

* 1.0

** Make auto updating the completion list buffer more responsive.

** Support commands which use completion-in-region in the minibuffer.

** Add basic Embark support.

** Highlight the completion at point in the completion list buffer
even when using normal navigation commands.

** Remove vcomplete-kill-buffer.
This was done as part of an effort to simplify the code base (since
third party solutions to completion actions exist).

** Optionally automatically update the completion list buffer.
See vcomplete-auto-update's documentation string for more information.

* 0.1

** Initial version.

* Versioning scheme
Vcomplete's versioning scheme is inspired by semver (https://semver.org/).
Each version number is of the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (patch may be
omitted if 0).
The MAJOR version is bumped when a user facing variable or function
changes in a way that could cause previous user configuration to
break (where user configuration considered is configuration done
through the customize interface).
A MAJOR version bump is very unlikely.
The MINOR version is bumped when a feature is added in a non-breaking
way.
The PATCH version is bumped when no feature is added (e.g. a version
with only fixes, or changes to documentation).

Note that versions before 1.0 did not follow this scheme.
