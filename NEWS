* Versioning scheme
Vcomplete's versioning scheme is inspired by semver (https://semver.org/).
Each version number is of the form MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (patch may be
omitted if 0).
The MAJOR version is bumped when a user facing variable or function
changes in a way that could cause previous user configuration to
break (where user configuration considered is configuration done
through the customize interface).
A MAJOR version bump is very unlikely.
The MINOR version is bumped when a feature is added in a non-breaking
way.
The PATCH version is bumped when no feature is added (e.g. a version
with only fixes, or changes to documentation).

Note that versions before 1.0 did not follow this scheme.
