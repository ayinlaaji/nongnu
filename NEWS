swsw NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

* 1.2 (currently in development)
No user facing changes have been made yet.

* 1.1.2

** Apply customization options immediately.
Customizing swsw-id-chars and swsw-scope and applying those changes now
causes all window IDs to update.

** Construct IDs without pre-computing all possible IDs.
This should hopefully help performance when dealing with a very large
number of windows.

** Fix the calculation of the ID length.
Previously the ID length reported was much bigger than it needed to be.

* 1.1.1

** Bump required Emacs version to 26.1.

** Add missing license information in several places.
The info was missing license information, and created archives were missing
the LICENSE file.

** Update the homepage of the package to dsemy.com/software/swsw.

** Update documentation strings.
Documentation string for several functions and variables have been updated to
be more clear and to better comply with Emacs' conventions.

** Update installation instructions.
Installation instructions have been updated to indicate the possibility of
installing the package from GNU ELPA.
Note: at the time of writing this isn't actually possible yet, but the
instructions have been updated since I'm expecting this to be possible soon.

* 1.1

** Add the ability to customize the scope of swsw-mode.
swsw-scope controls in which frames swsw-mode tracks windows.

** Fix conditional display functions potentially breaking when the user presses
C-g ('keyboard-quit') while reading a window ID.

** Bind C-x o to swsw-select in swsw-mode-map by default.

** Add an info node.
An info node (swsw) has been added which documents all user facing parts of the
package in detail.

* 1.0

** Stable version.
All user facing customization options will accept and correctly handle values
accepted by this version until (at least) version 2.0.
All user facing customization options introduced between this version and
version 2.0 will be accept and handle correctly values accepted by that version
until (at least) version 2.0.
Note: no version 2.0 is planned currently.

** Add support for multi-character IDs.
IDs can now be constructed from multiple character, taken from swsw-id-chars,
when there are enough tracked windows.

** Add support for alternate display functions.
A new customization variable has been added: swsw-display-function.
If it is set to a function, that function is used to display window IDs instead
of the mode-line lighter.
See the documentation of the variable for more information.
Two reference functions are provided:
swsw-mode-line-display-function displays window IDs similarly to the way they
were displayed before version 0.3.
swsw-mode-line-conditional-display-function displays window IDs in the same way
but only when window selection is in progress.

* 0.3

** Add a sparse key map to swsw-mode.
This allows creating key bindings which are only active when swsw-mode is.

** Use a mode-line lighter to show the window ID instead of adding it to the
start of the mode-line.
The lighter is only displayed if the window is tracked by swsw.

* 0.2

** Switching to the minibuffer is now possible.
It is now possible to switch to the minibuffer (if it's active) by
pressing a character unique to the minibuffer window (default 'm').

** Use read-char instead of read-char-from-minibuffer.
swsw-select used read-char-from-minibuffer with swsw-id-prompt as the
prompt previously.
The new implementation doesn't show a prompt (so swsw-id-prompt was
removed completely), and works on older Emacs versions.

* 0.1

** Initial version.
