Tools that help to develop the game

## compile.el ##

Compiles all the source code, treats warnings as errors and exits with
non-zero exit code on any error (which `cask build` does not yet).

## pacmacs-rr.el ##

RR stands for Record and Replay. Additional module for recording and
replaying integration test cases.
