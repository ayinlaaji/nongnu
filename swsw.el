;;; Commentary:

;; swsw (simple window switching) provides a minor mode for switching
;; windows using single character IDs shown on the mode line.

;;; Code:

;;;; Customization:

(defgroup swsw nil

  :group 'convenience
  :prefix "swsw-")

(defcustom swsw-id-chars-base '(?a ?s ?d ?f ?g ?h ?j ?k ?l)
  "Base set of characters from which window IDs are constructed."
  :group 'swsw
  :type '(repeat character))

(defcustom swsw-minibuffer-id ?m
  "ID reserved for the minibuffer."
  :group 'swsw
  :type '(character))
