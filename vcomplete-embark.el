;;; Commentary:

;; Embark integration for Vcomplete.
;;
;; Usage:
;;
;; Enable `vcomplete-embark-mode':
;;
;; (vcomplete-embark-mode)
;;
;; For use-package users:
;;
;; (use-package vcomplete
;;   :config
;;   (vcomplete-mode)
;;   (vcomplete-embark-mode))
;;
;; When `vcomplete-embark-mode' is active:
;; - Embark commands (like `embark-act') will operate on the
;;   highlighted completion in the completion list buffer (when
;;   available).
;;
;; For more information see the (Vcomplete) and (Embark) info nodes.
